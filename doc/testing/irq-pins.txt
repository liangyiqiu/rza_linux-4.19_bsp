In order to use the switches conneted to IRQ pins, you must first enable the GPIO Keyboard driver in the kernel.

Using menuconfig, enable:
  INPUT_KEYBOARD=y
  KEYBOARD_GPIO=y


  -> Device Drivers
    -> Input device support
      -> Generic input layer (needed for keyboard, mouse, ...) (INPUT [=y])
        -> Keyboards (INPUT_KEYBOARD [=y])
          -> GPIO Buttons (KEYBOARD_GPIO [=y])
